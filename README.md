# A Quick Rundown of React Native
In this tutorial, we will be creating a small application to demonstrate the basic features of React Native. Some of these basic features include:

- Using Components packaged in React Native's default library
- Using CSS and stylesheets to create the UI
- Using `axios` to make API calls
- Creating and updating our own Components

# How to navigate this tutorial
This tutorial is broken into parts navigable by the commands `./part1`, `./part2`, `./part3`. Each command will bring up a working instance of the application. The complete working application is available on the master branch, so if you want to view everything together, you do not need to navigate.

# Before Beginning
You should have downloaded Expo and learned to set up the basic "Hello World" example application. If you have not already done this, here are the links to set that up:

1. [Install Expo]

2. [Install Node.js]

3. [Create your first app]


## Additional Resources
React Native's code is a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript (version ES6). It is recommended you study each of these languages independently. Not only will they help you understand React Native in greater detail, they will also better your understanding of web development and UI in general. To that end, here are a few resources:

- [Learn JavaScript]
- [Learn HTML & CSS]
