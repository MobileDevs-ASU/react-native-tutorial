# A Quick Rundown of React Native
In this tutorial, we will be creating a small application to demonstrate the basic features of React Native. Some of these basic features include:

- Using Components packaged in React Native's default library
- Using CSS and stylesheets to create the UI
- Using `axios` to make API calls
- Creating and updating our own Components

# How to navigate this tutorial
This tutorial is broken into parts navigable by the commands `./part1`, `./part2`, `./part3`. Each command will bring up a working instance of the application. The complete working application is available on the master branch, so if you want to view everything together, you do not need to navigate.
